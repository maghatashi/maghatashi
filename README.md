- 👋 Hi, I’m @maghatashi.  A blockchain entrepreneur.
- 👀 I’m interested in sustainable deflationary token creation and hotwallets...
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to create token smart contracts and deploy them on solidity, but I am not a programmer.  I am just looking to learn how these things are created so <i can collaberate with programmers to create new projects and find solutions for more efficient systems...
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on whatever I post, really, but am open to ideas...
- 📫 How to reach me mhatashi@portico.dev...
